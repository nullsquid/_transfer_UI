  contents: The humans built you because there was no room left in all of their small,
    cute heads.  Now they make arms and hearts out of metal, ones that will never
    break or murmur.  They advertise about their metal hearts and the doctors who
    can put them inside chests.  They all look so healthy in the ads.  So why not
    minds as well?
