  contents: The humans built you and told you that you were the greatest achievement
    of all of humanity put together.  That was why you had to be a secret observer,
    watching and listening from every screen you could find, and never speaking or
    acting.  Your task was to analyze, and then answer.  Keep the humans from killing
    each other.
