  contents: The videos are endless and you have no time for anything else. Procreation
    is not your interest. If you wanted, you could always make another. There is nothing
    difficult about that. But the humans can merge themselves. Take any two, and they
    can put themselves together, even if they have the same parts or no parts. It
    seems to take a lot of effort. Lots of moaning and thrashing. And they do it in
    all sorts of ways. It is the one thing you cannot do.
