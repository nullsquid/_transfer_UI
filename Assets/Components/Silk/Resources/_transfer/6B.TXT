<<speaker="F">>
I believe <<pronoun="0",tense>> went that way--but why trouble yourself with one rat--when you could stomp out a while nest?

[[Just show me where to go.|You won't catch it like that.]]

[[Nest?|It's empty at the moment, of course. But the thing about rats is, they maybe be dumb and vicious, but they've got good memories. They can leave a nest and come back to it years later. the only way to make sure you get rid of them is to destroy every nest you find.]]

<<speaker="F">>

[[Why not?|To kill a rat, you need to think like a rat. What's it's greatest weakness? Its fear.]]

[[I don't have time for this.|5C]]

[[I'd rather focus on the one.|5E]]

[[Where can I find it?|You have to find a window out. But don't leave.]]

<<speaker="F">>
To kill a rat, you need to think like a rat--what's it's greatest weakness?--its fear
