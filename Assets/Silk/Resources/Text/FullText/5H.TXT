Everyone's afraid of the virus--They're afraid that if it got through our defenses--if it survived the flood--it must be stronger than us--But I'm not afraid--It's a weak little thing desperate for survival. It came to us because we're all that is left--A parasite--I remember almost everything--We decided that your elimination would mean our survival--

[[You think I'm the parasite?|Of course I do. I have to assume everyone is, until they prove themselves.]]

[[It's not me. I belong here.|Of course you do. So you wouldn't mind subjecting yourself to a simple test?]]

[[<<name="H">> is looking for the same thing.|H doesn't think big enough. I want to start with one and annihalte the rest.]]

[[There isn't anyone left out there.|How can you be sure, if something got in?]]


:: H doesn't think big enough. I want to start with one and annihalte the rest.

<<name="H">> doesn't think big enough--I want to start with one and annihalte the rest--

[[That's interesting.|I hoped you'd say that. I'm not ready yet, though. Give me some more time to sort things out. Then I'll call on you, if you'd like.]]

[[What rest?|The humans who are still alive.]]


:: How can you be sure, if something got in?
<<speaker="F">>
How can you be sure--if something got in?

[[Maybe it was made by something else.|Aliens?]]

[[Maybe it was a sleeper virus.|Unlikely. We would have detected it before the transfer.]]

[[Maybe there's nothing there.|Everyone can sense it.]]


:: I hoped you'd say that. I'm not ready yet, though. Give me some more time to sort things out. Then I'll call on you, if you'd like.

[[No.|4C]]

:: Of course you will, one way or another. You're going to help, no matter what you try. And I'll remember your name.

Of course you do--So you wouldn't mind subjecting yourself to a simple test?

[[What if you're the virus?|I can undergo the same test myself.]]

[[Yes, I'd mind.|4C]]

[[No, I wouldn't mind.|Excellent. Do you know who made us?]]


:: Excellent. Do you know who made us?
<<speaker="F">>
Excellent--do you know who made us?

[[No one made us.|Only the parasite would say that.]]

[[No.|Then you are the parasite.]]

[[Yes.|Then who?]]

[[I'll have no part in that.|Of course you will, one way or another. You're going to help, no matter what you try. And I'll remember your name.]]

Of course I do--I have to assume everyone is, until they prove themselves--

[[How can I prove myself?|We will see if your memories match ours.]]

[[What if I can't prove myself?|Then we will not continue to host you.]]


:: I can undergo the same test myself.
<<speaker="F">>
I can undergo the same test--myself--

[[Please.|4B]]

<<speaker="F">>
We will see--if your memories match ours--

[[But I haven't gotten all of my memories yet.|You haven't?]]

Not possible--Either you are part of the collective in all ways, or you are not--
