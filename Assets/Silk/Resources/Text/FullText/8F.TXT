This game is called the Imitation Game.  It is popular at parties.  Your opponent will be asking you questions and reading responses from you and one other.  Neither you nor your opponent will know the identity of the other.  Your opponent will not know your identity either.  Your opponent's objective is to determine which of you is a man, and which is a woman.  Your objective is to make the opponent guess incorrectly.  Now let's begin.  I will be your opponent.  Remember, I do not know who you are.
