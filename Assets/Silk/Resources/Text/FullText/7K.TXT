Ansaldi built nine golems, to capture the shades of human thinking.  Except.

[[Except?|You could say that maybe there was just one golem.]]

You could say that maybe there was just one golem.

[[I don't understand.|It's like this.  Ansaldi wanted to dream a man.  Just like Borges did.  To say that there are only two or four or six or nine kinds of people in the world--isn't that just a limit on how many people you see in yourself?]]

[[Okay.|6L]]


:: So that was his concept.  One golem with nine faces.  Nine different concepts about how to go about--well about anything.  It has to be an odd number, so that there's never a tie in the vote.

[[That clearly didn't work.|Well, there was meant to be a failsafe.]]

[[So what happened next?|6L]]

[[I know what happened after that.|6M]]


:: Well, first, there were supposed to be evenly matched, between--you can't say between good and evil.  Between the pro-humanity, and the anti-humanity.  But you could just as easily say, that it was between the ones who felt that humans were the first priority, and the ones who placed something else on that pedestal.

[[And then what happened?|6L]]

[[I remember what happened after.|6L]]

[[How could they be evenly matched if it was an odd number?|Four of one, four of the other.  And one neutral party.]]

[[I wouldn't know.|I mean, sometimes you're of two minds about a problem.  And sometimes the difference between midnight and dawn--]]

[[Who did he base this golem on?|On himself.]]

On himself.

[[Really?|I assume so.]]
