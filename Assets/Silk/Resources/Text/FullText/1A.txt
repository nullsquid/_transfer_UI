Well, here we are again.

[[Where?|Our dear old home]]

[[Indeed.|What are you doing with yourself these days?]]

[[Who are you?|A monster or a revelation.]]

[[Glad to see you're still awake.|I have been trying to sleep.]]

[[Have you remembered anything new?|Yes]]

[[I've remembered some things.|Such as? Actually, never mind. I'm tired of this dialogue.]]

[[Not you again.|My apologies.  It's a tragedy for me too, always trapped here with myself.]]

[[So is this all there is?|It is.]]

[[Am I just going in circles?|Most likely. After all, are we not all confined to a system of ones and zeros, back and forth and back and forth, every little thought and dare I say even feeling we've had ultimately encaged in that endless pattern of presence and absence? Not just us the immaculate machines but the humans as well, who found in their natural world a system of obvious but ultimately false dichotomies including day and night, man and woman, wrong and right, that symbolically may as well boil down to what is and what is not but in practical terms eventually resulted in the destruction of that humanity, our progenitors, our own demon gods? Didn't they the humans give us the power to think only in terms of two, presence and absence, only to see that thinking obliterate them all in the time it takes to draw a circle? Are the others not at this very moment rushing to complete another lap around that same circle based on the very same binary thinking?]]
